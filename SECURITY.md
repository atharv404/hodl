## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### 1. Keep Dependencies Updated
```bash
# Regularly update dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Secure Your Private Keys
```python
# NEVER commit private keys to Git
# NEVER share private keys
# Store keys in environment variables or secure key management systems

# Use .env file (add to .gitignore)
WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

#### 3. Environment Variables
```bash
# Use .env file for sensitive data
# Never commit .env to version control
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your secure values
```

#### 4. HTTPS in Production
```nginx
# Always use HTTPS in production
# Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
server {
    listen 80;
    return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}
```

#### 5. Database Security
```bash
# Restrict database file permissions
chmod 600 db/bch.db

# Regular backups
# Keep backups encrypted and off-site
```

### For Developers

#### 1. Input Validation
```python
# Always validate and sanitize inputs
def get_block(index):
    if not isinstance(index, int) or index < 0:
        raise ValueError("Invalid block index")
    # ... rest of code
```

#### 2. SQL Injection Prevention
```python
# Use SQLAlchemy's parameter binding
# NEVER use string formatting for SQL
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM blocks WHERE id = ?", (block_id,))
```

#### 3. Cryptographic Security
```python
# Use established cryptography libraries
from Crypto.PublicKey import RSA
from Crypto.Signature import pkcs1_15
from Crypto.Hash import SHA256

# Never implement your own crypto
```

#### 4. Error Handling
```python
# Don't leak sensitive information in errors
try:
    process_transaction()
except Exception as e:
    # Log detailed error internally
    logger.error(f"Transaction error: {e}", exc_info=True)
    # Return generic message to user
    return {"error": "Transaction processing failed"}, 500
```

#### 5. Rate Limiting
```python
# Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
from flask_limiter import Limiter

limiter = Limiter(
    app=app,
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["100 per minute"]
)
```

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. SQLite in Production
**Risk**: SQLite may not be suitable for high-concurrency production environments.

**Mitigation**: 
- Use PostgreSQL for production deployments
- Implement proper locking mechanisms
- Consider read replicas for scaling

### 2. Cryptographic Key Management
**Risk**: Keys stored in code or configuration files can be compromised.

**Mitigation**:
- Use environment variables
- Consider hardware security modules (HSM) for production
- Implement key rotation policies
- Use secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)

### 3. API Rate Limiting
**Risk**: API endpoints can be abused without rate limiting.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Use authentication for sensitive operations
- Monitor for unusual patterns

### 4. Smart Contract Execution
**Risk**: Malicious smart contracts could consume excessive resources.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement execution time limits
- Set memory limits
- Use sandboxed execution environment
- Validate contract code before execution

### 5. Network Communication
**Risk**: Data transmitted over network can be intercepted.

**Mitigation**:
- Always use HTTPS/TLS in production
- Implement certificate pinning for critical connections
- Validate SSL certificates

## Security Checklist

## Security Headers

Implement these security headers in production:

```python
@app.after_request
def add_security_headers(response):
    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'"
    return response
```

## Dependency Security

### Checking for Vulnerabilities
```bash
# Use pip-audit to check for known vulnerabilities
pip install pip-audit
pip-audit

# Or use safety
pip install safety
safety check
```

### Keeping Dependencies Updated
```bash
# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated

# Update specific package
pip install --upgrade package-name

# Update all packages (use with caution)
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Incident Response

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Contain**: Immediately limit the damage
2. **Assess**: Determine the scope and impact
3. **Notify**: Inform affected parties
4. **Fix**: Deploy patches/fixes
5. **Document**: Record what happened and lessons learned
6. **Improve**: Update security measures

### Emergency Contacts

For critical security issues:
1. Create a private security advisory on GitHub

- Implement appropriate data protection measures
- Follow GDPR/CCPA guidelines if applicable
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement data retention policies

import logging

# Log all security-relevant events
logger.info(f"User {user_id} accessed wallet {wallet_id}")
